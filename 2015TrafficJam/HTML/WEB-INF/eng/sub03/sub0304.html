			<p class="sub-tit03 mt-10">(1) Tendency of accident free driver</p>
 	 	 	<ul class="yakguan-list2">
				<li><span>•</span> 	
				Drive carefully
 	<p>Make effort to respond well to the changes of road or traffic environment. When making the direction or lane change, always inform with signal light or hand signal, and when driving at night in particular, do not only drive depending on the indications of the traffic light, but also consider the fact that there are people who violate the laws and regulations, speeding and jaywalking</p>
					</li>

<li><span>•</span> Do not undertake anything that interferes with driving
 		<p>While driving, knowing the fact that in case when the driver is in negligence of focusing the front view by unnecessary actions such as looking elsewhere can lead to major accident thus it is best not to do anything that reduces attention span such as use of mobile phone, smoking, watching TV and talking.</p>
					</li>

<li><span>•</span> Restraint the impulsive act and control yourself
 		<p>Always have the awareness of speeding and passing is dangerous and drive with care. Acknowledge the misery of the accident and do not rush, get upset or be excited while driving.</p>
					</li>

			<p class="sub-tit03 mt-10">(2) Tendency of prone to accident drivers</p>
 	 	  	 	 	<ul class="yakguan-list2">

				<li><span>•</span>Self-centered
 	<p>Thoroughly critical on the matters inconsistent to his own opinion. They tend to think that they violation of signal or passing is inevitable while other drivers commit such action, it is intentional and habitual behavior.</p>
					</li>

				<li><span>•</span> Significant fluctuation of emotion
 	 	<p>Severely temperamental. Small things make him edge and take action as wish without considering the consequences and has the tendency to ignore the traffic laws and regulations and drive recklessly.</p>
					</li>

				<li><span>•</span> Aggressive
 	 	<p>When he is angry, take whatever the action available. Driver gets upset when other driver passes him and even when the car in the front drives under the speed limit, he make the other driver nervous by tailgating with high beam on or honking.</p>
					</li>
			</ul>

 	 	 	<p class="tbl-tit mt-20">[The aggressive drivers have higher tendency to be in the frequent accident driver]</p>

 	 	  	 	 	<ul class="yakguan-list2">
<li><span>•</span>Hysterical
 	<p>Easy to get mad and easy to get excited over minor things. He has hard time tolerating the traffic jam and when traffic does not move immediately after change of traffic light, he would honk and urge other driver to move forward.
</p>
					</li>
<li><span>•</span>Lack in self-control
 	<p>Whatever was on his mind can not be reserved. For example, if passing the car was on mind, he does it no matter what the risk is. Knowing the fact that traffic laws and regulations has to be abided, he/she is quick to follow when other cars commit violation and think certain level of violation is inevitable depend on the situation.</p>
					</li>

<li><span>•</span>Lack of consideration for others
 	<p>Consider his position only and not about the others. He would not slow down for pedestrian but to use the horn to forcefully move them out of the way or refuse allow others to cut in on the merged area.</p>

 	  	 	  <ul class="yakguan-list2">	 	
				<li><span>•</span>Restrain the mind from rushing mode
					People tend to hurry things even when driving without time constraint. You need to immediately recognize the fact that ‘rushing mode’ come in when you are upset or angry while you are driving.</p>
									</li>

				<li><span>•</span>Relax and drive
					There is always the rushing mind or wrong action of driver behind the scene of accident. After you are already in the rushing mode it is hard to recover the relaxed mind thus, you should not create the situation to be in the rushing mode in the first place.</p>
					</li>

			<p class="sub-tit02">B. Elderly driver and Safe driving</p>
 	 		<p class="sub-tit03 mt-10">(1) Characteristics of elderly drivers
 	  	  	  <ul class="yakguan-list2">		 	
				<li><span>•</span>Takes longer to apply the brake
 	<p>Elderly drivers should always maintain safe distance with the car in the front because it takes longer time to react to the danger. Also reduce the speed and prepare for sudden danger if possible.</p>
					</li>

				<li><span>•</span> When fatigue, the vision is drastically weakens
 	 	<p>Avoid long distance trip if possible and take frequent rest for long distance driving.</p>
					</li>

				<li><span>•</span>Takes longer to focus the vision
 	 	<p>Maintain safe distance by reducing the speed because there may be delay in the risk detection and takes longer to look into the rear view mirror.</p>
					</li>

				<li><span>•</span>Risk anticipation capability is declined
 	 	<p>An elderly have high risk of involve in accident in a sudden danger situation due to panic, the best policy is reducing the speed.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

 	 	<p class="sub-tit03 mt-10">(2) Consideration for elderly driver</p>
 	 	 	<p class="sub-txt">With the prolonged average life span, and longer survival period after the retirement, elderly driver became a part of ordinary feature on the road and became a reality that is not totally irrelevant to my family but with myself as well. Rather than hurl stream of profanity at slow moving vehicle or hesitant driver when you come across with by taking advantage for being anonymous, think of elderly as if they can be your parents or even yourself someday and courteous attitude is in order.</p>

 	<p class="sub-tit02">C. Safe Driving following the Major Traffic Laws and Regulations</p>
 	 	<p class="sub-tit03 mt-10">(1) Compliance with signal and safe passing of intersection</p>
 	 	 	<p class="sub-txt">All cars must follow the instruction of signal or traffic safety sign, police officer on traffic duty, and other officials. At this time, signal and instruction by the police officer take the priority.
Among the regulatory sign of the safety signs, violations apply only 12 safety signs in conjunction which are street closed sign, do not enter sign and stop sign.</p>
